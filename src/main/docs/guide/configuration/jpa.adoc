You can define Flyway configuration for each datasource. The following example demonstrates using it:

[source, yaml]
.src/main/resources/application.yml
----
include::{flywaytests}/groovy/io/micronaut/flyway/docs/FlywaySpec.groovy[tag=yamlconfig,indent=0]
----

<1> Disable schema DDL creation.
<2> Define flyway configuration under `flyway.datasources` key.
<3> Configure flyway configuration for `default` data source.
<4> The migrations directory is `src/main/resources/databsemigrations`.

In that directory you need to include all your migrations, for example:

[source,sql]
.resources/databasemigrations/V1__create-books-schema.sql
----
include::{flywaytests}/resources/databasemigrations/V1__create-books-schema.sql[indent=0]
----

NOTE: Starting with Micronaut `1.1.3` it is not necessary to define the `jpa` configuration if you only want to run the migrations but not actually use JPA.
